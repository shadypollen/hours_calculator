# Work Hours Calculator

A small CLI app that records the day you've worked, your hours, subtracts unpaid times from break and records data into a SQLite-database.

##Necessary libraries
*SQLite

##Using the app

Download the zip of the master branch or clone the repository and run
```
python3 hours_calculator.py
```

Follow the instructions given on screen and after you have entered all the necessary data the program will create 2 tables. One is for a day-by-day view of how much you've worked per week and the second one is a weekly overview.
